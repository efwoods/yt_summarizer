hey everyone welcome back we'll now move into our last event of cute guy 2021 a presentation by siobhan zillas now siobhan is the project director at neurolink's office of the ceo and has worked with tesla and open ai she's a fellow at u of t's creative destruction lab and a founder and partner of bloomberg beta she will be speaking on the future of brain machine interfaces to connect humans and computers everyone please welcome siobhan hey guys um i love that intro walk on music i kind of want to take that everywhere i go um thank you guys for having me here today i as uh as max mentioned so i grew up in markham ontario uh you know definitely had not thought about a ai at all growing up and actually it's probably before your guys time but there's a band called our lady piece that did this album called the age of spiritual machines and that led me to read this ray kurzweil book on basically like human ai symbiosis and i think i was 12 or 13 at the time and just like could not get ai out of my head from then onwards um then ended up as as a canadian would you know played a lot of hockey ended up taking the sat ended up in the us and have basically spent pretty much all the last decade focused in and around ai unfolding in the world in the in the best way possible and so what that looked like for six years was investing in startups that were using ai for net good things for the world and also working with a bunch of non-profits um and one of those nonprofits was uh was open ai and that's how i ended up meeting uh elon ended up working spending two years working on just basically the suite of ai projects in the portfolio so that was uh ai trips at tesla self-driving neurolink uh and then open ai and i mean the thing i'm going to talk to you guys about today is neural language which has been like kind of the most fascinating thing i've and complicated but like also fascinating thing i've ever encountered in my life um which does fold into ai uh you know i unfolded in the best possible way in the world but more from an existential perspective so you know back when i was at bloomberg beta i was really focusing on like applications for good and as i thought about it more and more i was like well you know ai's going to be one of the most fundamentally transformative technologies humanity creates if not the most and so we just need to make sure you know from a humanity perspective this this goes well um and so let me hop over into my presentation what i'll do is there's gonna be just a ton of content here i'm gonna try and get through it in 25 30 minutes and then essentially give the rest of the time over to questions because i'm sure there will be some and just stop me at any time if anything goes squirrely or you can't hear me but here we go so just a quick quick primer on on neuralink in general um it's like why are we why are we even doing this in the first place so i think there's a there's both a short term and a long-term goal of gnarling the short-term goal is basically solve important brain and spine problems with a seamlessly implanted device and you know this is definitely easier said than done uh your brain is a very sensitive organ that has a whole bunch of things around it that historically just has never been messed with you know we've been doing invasive things in medicine for you know many hundreds of years but definitely not not dealing in the brain region because it's it's the trickiest task you can you can possibly choose for yourself so that's definitely the short-term goal and you know if you think about it every single component of your reality everything you've ever touched any memory you've ever had anything you've ever felt like all of this is just signals emanating from your brain and so when we talk about creating a platform to directly interface with the brain you have the potential just to modulate literally everything right because everything is just these signals and in terms of our experience in the world and so that's really the short-term goal and a lot of what i'm going to focus on today but the way this i mentioned to you neuralink does also fold into ai unfolding in the world in the best possible way and so our long-term reason for existence is something that's a little bit more science fiction oriented but like honestly if you look at enough enough years you're like yeah this is definitely going to be a reality so you know you know how do we how do we make this good for humanity and that's basically when the age of artificial super intelligence hits right so every single year artificial intelligence gets more and more and more intelligent of course now that's sort of within a constrained controllable fashion but if you look out 10 years if you look out 50 years if you look at 100 years there's no reason this technology doesn't get basically more and more intelligent and more and more powerful year on year and so if you compare contrast you know humans to artificial intelligence or just basically silicon-based intelligence i don't necessarily know that we'll consider it artificial forever um but one of the things that we have uh is you know we've got a lot going on in our own heads but the actual communication bandwidth between humans and between humans and computers is actually relatively low right so i'm i'm showing you some images i'm saying some words the bitrate on that communication is is relatively low compared with what computers can do with each other or even to some degree what uh computers would be able to express to us if if we had some sort of higher bandwidth opportunity so um you know this is one of these things that again it sounds way out there but you know as superintelligence hits the world one of the things we kind of want to exist is just the optionality to have a high bandwidth interface with it so we just keep high communications and you know basically like allows humanity to go along for the ride and so you know honestly the probability of our probability of us being able to do this successfully in the time frame allowed started at zero percent and so you know we literally exist to to raise that probability above zero percent um we've been working really hard for the past four years i think we've gotten the probability up to you know generously one to two percent and we just we just hope to keep um elevating it from there and so just to step back for a hot second you know like what are we talking about in the first place so your brain is an electrochemical system you've got a lot of neurons you've got billions of neurons in your brain they're connected to each other through synapses so um neurons have variable number of connections with other neurons but a lot of what's happening in your brain is just basically a fundamental wiring and rewiring of these synaptic connections through time and because the brain has electrical properties one thing we can do is uh essentially put an electrode in the brain that allows it to hear electrical signals from nearby neurons and so that's essentially what we're trying to do and you know one one question that often comes up is hey you know like why do you have to go inside of the brain for this and there are a lot of things happening in terms of reading brain signals externally but because our end goal we have we have two goals one one is to just really fundamentally help people with debilitating brain disorders and the other is to get to that high bandwidth interface and just basically the physics of how this all works doesn't allow us to get to significant enough resolution on either a read or right dimension in terms of a brain machine interface and so um it would be our preference not to have to go inside the brain but it's just per our current understanding of physics impossible to do it from outside and so we're not the first ones to want to do things with the brain so i'm just going to quickly walk you through a couple of things that that exists today uh in terms of best in class for uh medical research the most popular device used to interface with the brain directly is called a utah array this essentially has a 100 silicon shanks attached to a base plate so if you look at that image on the bottom right side um these are again the you've got two millimeters per scale there so you've got these relatively teeny tiny but still large silicon shanks you kind of you rest that thing on top of the brain you use a pneumatic hammer to like put it inside the brain and end off you wrote but um a few things are are definitely constrained here i mean one is the fact that this has existed for a couple of decades it hasn't really progressed um and again one of the goals of this was to just understand the brain a little bit better the goal was never to take this to humans in a way that they could actually use uh to either enhance themselves or to solve any any particular just brain ailment that that could be flagging them and the other the other tricky things about this which again what we look at ourselves is essentially trying to move beyond the utah array as our first step is if you if you take a look here you've got these these ports that come out of the brain and anytime you have a percutaneous port that gives sort of like a very high risk of infection because you have this constantly open thing and so from the get-go for neural link it was just not an option to have anything percutaneous which from an engineering perspective um inserts a whole bunch of challenges but they're ones that we're pretty excited to solve um and then one other thing that we'll get into a little bit is just the fact that you know if you think about your brain people use different things like kind of like what overcooked wet spaghetti or yogurt but your brain is this like fundamentally soft medium that's kind of pulsing up and down and when we think about brain machine interfaces we want something that's going to last on the order of decades before you have to to upgrade it and one material property of these silicon shanks in the utahrey is that they're extraordinarily stiff and so when you basically have a stiff medium and a pulsating soft medium you're you're basically causing chronic damage to the brain through time because you kind of have a sword in a squishy thing that's that's moving over and over again so you're creating additional tissue damage so that's what's happening on the research side uh in terms of what's happening that's clinically available there are a few devices that again i think will look back in 10 years and consider these relatively medieval which is good it means humanity will be progressing but uh they actually these fundamentally simple and invasive and actually relatively dangerous devices actually do a lot of good already um so there basically is precedent to show that when you are able to safely put something in the brain you can really really help people and so i've got just one example here which is a deep brain stimulator unlike the thing i just showed you which was a fundamentally read-based device so i was trying to read neural signals what this is trying to do is trying to inject current to essentially regulate certain areas of the brain that are just misfiring in certain ways so in this case this is a deep brain stimulator you can either do it unilaterally or bilaterally this image shows a bilateral insertion you put these uh basically these stimulating electrode channels deep in the deep in the brain region that's malfunctioning and you just apply stimulation current to regulate that area one of the downsides of this to date is that again because it is a bit dangerous it's not always effective only people who have very very debilitating conditions that have absolutely no other recourse are eligible to get it so an example would be somebody who has just uncontrolled parkinson's tremors and something like stage four parkinson's would be eligible but again it's there's a very high bar for for putting this stuff to use [Music] and so that takes us to what neural link is building this is a this is a a snapshot of what the device looks like today um i'm going to call attention to a couple of things and just kind of walk you through how we got here and so just as a just as a fundamental backdrop here i've i've worked with probably a couple hundred startups in my life and both the blessing and the curse of gnarling is that i've just never seen so many different dimensions that have to come together to make a single device work right so you know in our case if you take a look at those threads uh i'm going to just hop forward one slide it's a little bit difficult to tell here but what you're seeing is 64 individual threads each of those threads has 16 working electrodes on it and those connect back up into the package and so if you were to pull up pull off one of these individual threads and look at it you'd have to you would barely be able to see it and if if you weren't holding on to it very close it's just this teeny wisp of hair it's about the third the width of a human hair that would just float off and you'd never be able to find it again so we're trying to build something that small something flexible something that just kind of hides inside the brain and moves with the brain brain's material properties and so we've ended up having to lean on a lot of micro fabrication experts to basically build this thin film electrode array technology um again in contrast to those silicon shanks we were just like this was it was completely a non-starter for us to to do anything that would cause chronic injury to the brain and so that's definitely been kind of several years of work of neurolink to be able to get those electrodes thin flexible relatively invisible to the brain um and uh and then obviously be able to integrate that with a broader electronics package so where we've gotten basically the a lot of what we've done in in the last year or so uh so we've been refining everything but one fundamental architecture change that uh you know elon looked at and insisted on is our original instantiation for this the simplest thing we could have possibly thought of to make this work uh it was was the image you see here and so you see basically uh you've got these four little divots that go in the skull there and that was just the thread and um the the chip that did the analog to digital conversion of the signals from the brain um routing down to basically a wireless data transfer and then we had a battery that set on the outside so we would power this with a swappable battery um elon decided he was just like look you know guys we got to simplify and we got to make this completely invisible um because he's like i just you know some somebody who has somebody who's going about life through this it should people should not be able to tell the difference it needs to be completely invisible and so we ended up swapping to this one architecture which is is very clean um but basically if you think about what we have to solve here we basically have the threads that are coming off underneath that that implant we have the implant itself which has to house so we've got 1024 channels per device so you basically have to be able to convert all the signals there get all of the data off the head and provide enough battery life that this is deeply functional and useful to somebody that that needs to use it and so here's kind of the the implant side of it which is kind of half half of what neural link is focused on from it from an engineering perspective so again 10 24 channels what we do is we we needed to shrink it to his size both in terms of width and height that basically um fills the cavity of the skull that that we removed to insert it right so it ends up just being another piece of your skull at the end of the day and then what we did is create an inductive uh charging system so you basically you know right now we have it like this we are working on animal models and we charge just with this little puck uh that's able to charge the implant uh through the through the skin without raising temperature causing any other biological damage and then what we'll do as we move to humans is uh i i'm pretty sure what it's going to end up looking like and i can use a canadian word which is making me really happy you probably have like a a charging toque um i know here we have to call it bini which is just completely infuriating to me so you basically have a charging hat that would allow you to charge it when you're not using it or continue to charge it while you are using it um so that's the one half that's the actual implant if you move over to how do you actually get it there's the surgery and so um you know we're looking to move to our first human patients in the next say six to nine months we're actually going through our initial fda process right now and our eventual goal is to make this as easy and simple as lasik the first surgeries will not be that um but that that is the end goal and in order to do that one of the things so we spend a lot of time and energy on robotics at neurolink link one of the cool things about that is you know i i've had a lot of friends in robotics over the years and robots are just cool like they just absolutely are awesome they're fascinating but a lot of people sometimes build robots because they're they're fun and they're cool but they're not necessary in the case of neuralink the robot is just completely necessary for for two reasons um and reason one is i talked to you guys a little bit about the the threads that we have to insert um the it basically kind of operates like how a sewing machine would work so there's a there's a little loop at the end of the thread and what our robot does is uh and i'll show you a video of it in just a second it grabs each of those 64 threads and inserts them into a very specific area of the brain and you could be the best human neurosurgeon in the world you have absolutely no shot of doing this because you just need micron precision right and a human hand just cannot possibly um can't possibly do that from a motor control perspective in the first place but in the second place there's just no way you'd be able to do it fast enough to be able to grab all of those threads and put them very precisely in the brain um and so we we absolutely just fundamentally need a robot like when we devise this device we're like well we can't even think of this device without thinking of a robot surgeon and so um just as early as we were working on the implant we were working on the the robotic surgeon to actually be able to implant the device and so the rough outline of what happens in the surgery is again you have to pull back a skin flap you have to take out a portion of the skull that's done by a human right now and then you have a surgical robot come in implant all of the different electrodes and then you have the human kind of close up and again nothing percutaneous patient looks completely normal and now let me introduce you to the robot so as you can see the robot has a massive base and one of the reasons there are a few reasons why the robot's so big so one again micron precision we need a bit of weight there just to ensure that we're not wobbling all over the place um thing two is we just have an insane amount of just optical technology again it's it's mostly hidden by that shroud there uh but we have a whole bunch of different wavelengths of just passive optics and then we have something called optical coherence tomography with and we actually have a the highest resolution optical coherence tomography setup in the world and what that allows us to do is compute a 3d map of the brain because not only do we have to find a way to just insert around different blood vessels but the brain is constantly pulsating and if you want to get within a few micron precision with each of these insertions we have to be able to very um very accurately track the brain in 3d space and so i think next slide is slight gruesome alert i'm very normalized to this but for anyone that hasn't seen brains before i'm gonna i'm just gonna let this play a couple of times because it kind of shows one of the reasons why it's just absolutely critical to have a robot um you can see the vasculature on the top of the brain and so if you think of something like a utah array that just had that you know that broad bucket of spikes when they put that in they're just puncturing a bunch of these blood vessels and that's terrible for a number of reasons one you know uh it it creates an acute and chronic immune response when there's just enough um blood that uh let me just play this puppy again there we go uh you don't want to create that immune response what that ends up doing is your brain sends a whole just a whole bunch of um things like astrocytes and glia that just glom onto the electrodes um and basically tag them as a foreign body and they're like no no you're not doing this we're going to shove you out of the brain and we're just going to coat you so you can't hurt us anymore so you obviously can't get brain signals when your electrodes are coated and beyond that sometimes if you do puncture one of these vessels i mean the blood vessels are there to oxygenate the cells and so you're just going to knock out an entire column of the neurons that you're trying to record from um and so for us this surgical robot and again i showed it to you in one quick slide here this has been this has been many years of work to get it to be this um precise to be able to grab uh to grab the thread and insert it in the brain around the vasculature um and so one kind of kind of interesting and funny thing about this this whole situation is you know you've got that robot that's just absolutely massive the only part that interacts with the brain is that little needle which starts its life as a 40 micron wide a tungsten radium piece of wire and then we have a femtosecond later that sorry femtosecond laser that reductively manufactures it um with about eight different cuts into this very precise geometry that basically grabs the thread and then is able to look at the brain insert it pierce through the meninges on top of the brain without causing damage insert that thread and then retract and do that 64 times in a surgery and so that's all of the uh the the implant and robotic side of things to get this in the brain but once we get in the brain the question is does it work and so i'm gonna go over just a couple of things we've done um to date so in august of last year we ended up sharing some of our first large animal results um and so just to give you guys a backdrop of of how this works you know our our preference of course would be if we didn't have to use animal models the reality of the situation is is the fda and just in general you have to test these things on non-humans before you move into humans and the way we end up going about that is uh and our whole company has this ethos anything that can possibly ever be tested outside of an animal animal model has to be tested outside of an animal model and so we've invested a lot of time and energy in doing things like hardware and loop testing a lot of visual inspection on the devices and we basically have a whole bunch of chemical tests as well that we subject the implants to once you've done that it's time to test in animal models and so we are primarily using two models right now for the the human grade implant and so the first one of those is pigs and what we use pigs for is is basically anything we can do that doesn't require extremely rich behavior uh and so here's an example of just actual brain signals coming out of a pig so this is a sound of thought this is the sound of reality um the way our brain communicates is in action potentials and what we basically do i'll let me hop back to that other slide even though it's a little bit loud um because we have to have everything on a head what we've done is is basically so the the models for reading things reading signals from motor cortex and actually being able to map them to useful behavior are not overwhelmingly complex so what we've tried to do is basically shrink the footprint of the chip and make it as strength the analog pixel and make it as less power-hungry as we possibly can and then what we're basically doing on head is we're template matching to the shape that you see on the right in in the blue which is the shape of an action potential so every time your your neuron wants to fire it depolarizes and repolarizes and and gives you kind of a signature shape which we then identify on a template that we have on head and we're essentially shipping just all of the spike data that we get and the temporal signatures associated with that so that's that's what we're shipping off head to then run our models uh and here's just a raster plot of what this ends up looking like across 1024 channels in this particular case we had so if you think about a pig and it's like what does a pig spend most of its life doing it spends most of its life kind of rooting around with its snout both from a tactile and scent perspective and so what you're basically seeing here is every time you get one of these hills we're stroking the pig's nose um and for anyone who has seen our august event from last year we uh we had this kind of rigged up to a musical setup so you basically were playing the big nose like a musical instrument just to just show the efficacy of the brain signal uh we also did just a basic uh motor fitting model so we had piggies are very food motivated and they're huge sweethearts so you can see this this piggy on a on a treadmill getting some snacks um she's walking and essentially we're basically fitting a model to uh the emotions that she's making as you can see predicts quite close to reality again this is with a single 24 channel device in one hemisphere of the brain tracking one half of the pig's body and so that's kind of as far as you can push on sort of like pig behavior you can't really really really train a pig to do richer behaviors um and so that's what we've done with pig model so using that both to just prove that we are reading useful signals from the brain and also to just show the pig is our main model to show that there are no chronic health effects uh that happen as a result of of our implant and so that's the animal model we're using in our fda study everything from the get-go that neurolink has created is also read write compatible i think some of our first applications and humans which i'll get into in just a moment are going to be read heavy just because that's the thing that's going to be more useful in cortex-based applications that we're focusing on right now but we're we've also just run the set of experiments we need to to ensure that we are effective right effectively writing information to the brain and so the way we do this is uh this is done in primarily mouse models just for for debugging what you do is you end up inserting a fluorescent virus into a brain uh and stimulating in a way that when the neuron fires uh you basically can see just light around it so we've got two threads in here which you can see in red we're stimulating each of those threads and you can see the neurons associated with or just basically proximate to that thread end up end up firing so we're writing information into the brain when you zoom out this is just essentially what you see these are just different vertical slices of the brain but you're seeing that when we stimulate there is just gross neuronal activity in that region and so one of the things we can do over time is see basically how little current we we can inject to enact the change that we want to see but just like a computer these interfaces are are going to be read write compatible so where are we right now um we're focusing on a couple of things the thing that is most important to us is safely getting a useful device to humans in need as quickly as possible uh what we're focusing on out of the gate is helping quadriplegics get digital freedoms back right so anybody who just has completely lost movement um south of their neck uh what they'll be able to do is essentially use a computer in the same way with the same fidelity that you or i could um and again i think that the first patient will be able to do with some fidelity but there's no reason that we couldn't get to essentially again the same bandwidth that you are you or i get and i think the thing that i'm excited about is you know getting it to the level where you know somebody who you know used to love love video games for example uh unfortunately you know became quadriplegic can just like whoop my ass at their favorite video game um and that is of course you know a little bit a little bit of a more fun application than others but uh for somebody to be able to actually contribute back to society by doing meaningful work on their laptops being able to stay socially connected to loved ones that's the place that we're starting and so in order to ensure that all of our systems are up to speed by the time we get to first humans this is where we transition over to monkey research which we again very low numbers of monkeys these monkeys are treated super well they're just like huge sweethearts and what we're doing uh primarily right now is we're inserting our devices into both hemispheres focusing on the motor cortex and we're having the monkeys do specific tasks and so elon had mentioned in a clubhouse inter i guess club has interview presentation whatever you call it the cool kids are calling it these days but he had um shared just at a high level one thing that we have been working on which is monkeys playing pong with their brains um i won't share in too much detail right now because we're going to have something coming out in the in the next couple of weeks but the i mean it's pretty cool monkeys are playing pong with their brains um and so primarily we worked on motor cortex one thing we were also putting a bit of effort into and is also inserting these devices into visual cortex with the thought that our second or maybe third application in humans will be just visually reconstructing um images for people who are blind and so what that looks like right now is essentially using the devices to read the information that's coming in uh through through the monkey's eyes and uh basically recomputing that on on a screen so you can at least see kind of course imagery uh and our goal is to improve the resolution of that over time and so yeah i just talked a little bit about you know this this final monkey demo is kind of functionally the last step on the path to humans um we have them working on tasks like pong but we also have them working on tasks that are extremely similar to what a human is going to want to use out of the gate and so this is just a render of what the neuralink app will look like so there's a calibration phase where you know you essentially ask the patient to think move to the right and as it moves to the right it trains the model uh and then once you figure out right left up down what you can do is is find our granularity and basically move in a circle like you saw here so monkeys are currently performing that task as well and they're doing quite well at it and then once you get beyond that you can see you could very get a very rudimentary keyboard out there that would basically allow a human just basically type out whatever they're they're typing out in this case you are using just basically sort of like 2d control with a click as we move further down the line uh their existence proof to show that we might be able to shortcut a whole bunch of different things like in the same way that you have that little swipe function in your phone instead of just like tapping buttons and you have autocomplete you could do things like that or you could even tap into language areas of the brain and transcribe just basically full words or full thoughts based on neural patterns so it's it's the future's gonna get super super interesting um but so that's that's really what we've been working on right now we're just super heads down trying to see how far we can push the models in advance of getting to first human and as i mentioned we're going through our first series of fda studies um just to essentially prove that this is going to be safe and efficacious for first human and one thing i'll close on just before questions is just that like the vast array of talent types that we need at the company um one of the things that's been super exciting for me is just one i get really excited by working with brilliant and good-hearted people who are excellent at things that are adjacent to to what i know right and so getting to work with the best material scientists roboticists neurosurgeons um and we have a whole bunch of just like fundamental scientists too that are dealing with the more biological side of things um working with the best animal animal care specialists um and then again the best folks in terms of like actually building models that understand like neural networks for our neural networks like right now it's mostly linear models just because we're working in motor cortex but um it's going to get meta pretty soon neural networks on neural networks and it's just been anyway it's been it's been a super fun experience i'm i'm stoked to be able to share a little bit with you guys and happy to answer any questions you might have thanks so much siobhan that was that was such an amazing presentation so i'll throw up some questions here now and then okay so just to start off with a more general one so by your estimate approximately how long do you think it'll be until healthy humans can start getting the neural implant it's a good question i think part of this is predicated on the what so a lot of what i showed you guys is um what we've been focusing on out of the gate is cortex-based application so your cortex is obviously like at the top is quite accessible once you make that craniotomy you're just basically inserting directly into the brain region that that you want to read and write to um for cortex-based applications again i mentioned quadriplegics were the were the first set of patients that we were we were going to serve in part because there's just huge need there and in part also because there's no loss like the i mean if you're quadriplegic you're not using your motor cortex to move your body right so we're inserting into unused brain just to give upside um where we move beyond that i think there are a bunch of different paths we could take so that could get so high bandwidth that you or i may eventually want it right just in terms of a direct interface with our computers i think that's less probable um for first applications for healthy humans another thing that we've been we've been thinking about and talking about a lot is a lot of a lot of the most paralyzing ailments um for humans tend to be in deeper brain regions so you know ptsd anxiety obesity um there are a lot of things that that just go get again like extreme depression to the point where you're suicidal like some of that stuff just doesn't have kind of chemical remedies um and things like insomnia for example so if you're able to access deep brain regions you can treat a whole bunch of other ailments but that also may be the shorter path to translating into something that would uh help a healthy human um like as an example for me i'm like well i don't have insomnia but like you know sometimes getting to sleep at night is a little bit tricky if you had something that was truly at the invasiveness of lasik that could help you get to bed and help you get like a full night of rest i mean you'd be kind of crazy not to get it right and so that happens to be the thing that i'm i'm particularly interested in just in terms of the first thing i would want as a relatively healthy human a lot of people have different answers to that question so if you were looking for something that again just unequivocally is going to going to take you to better control like of your computers and your digital devices and be your default way of interacting you're probably looking at 12 to 15 years um again pending fda cycles and various other things like that but if you're looking for something i have a i have a sneaking hypothesis that some of the deeper brain implants will be desired by relatively healthy people on a shorter time scale um but again on the earliest you're looking at seven to ten years plus whatever additional regulatory cycle was required to make it just like universally available but i think the existence proof will exist in seven to ten years yeah wow that's that's pretty soon honestly in the grand scheme of things but yeah it's kind of wild i like neurolink we think in months and people are like oh what's six months out we're like it's two weeks like i don't know yeah well the ambition that's definitely getting the job done um but just to follow up to that so have you guys actually kind of delved into some of the emotion kind of like the deeper brain stuff that you were talking about or is that something that's just not too high of a priority a little bit farther off um so one thing i think i didn't probably explain clearly enough is there there are a lot of folks within the neuroscience community in research that are targeting very specific things one of the things that we've been focused on is just there's literally a chicken and egg problem right where like there is no fundamental brain platform that exists and so both our understanding and our ability to treat are just are just hamstrung right now because humanity just does not get how the brain works on mass um and so for us a lot of people be like hey you know you should should we partner up on things or we do this and we're like guys we can't wait like as soon as we have this like stable brain platform that we can you know allow others to use or use ourselves for a fundamental understanding of the brain like that would be sweet we're like focused on the engineering and the biology of it right now um and again we are learning things about the brain but it's just like it's so early days compared to what things will look like in five to ten years so understanding that underpinnings of like what fundamentally governs more complex emotions like we're just not there yet like i don't we're like a little bit there is humanity by virtue of some fmri and related experiments but like it's honestly it's been very humbling because the brain is the thing i think humanity understands least out of like i think for example like the ai we've created is way way in excess of how much we understand how much our own brains work right it's just it's just super early yeah for sure um okay so in terms of like actually implementing the the neuralink device like how do you you sort of touch on this a bit but if you go into like a little bit more detail about mediating the immune response from the electrodes yeah and so we talked about two things and the two things we talked about were just as much as possible matching the material property of the brain and doing everything we can do to prevent um an immune response that would be caused by bleeding right because that is one of the major signals to the brain responses like is is blood in a place where it's not supposed to be so those are two of the things that we focus on another thing that we worked on and again i mentioned we have some more fundamental um uh biological talent at neuralink uh you can do things like co coat the electrodes um in in different proteins and just basically different compounds that do also mitigate immune response um and you can also just do the very simple things like uh administer antibiotics and various other things uh at time of surgery but it's basically those those are the four mechanisms that we have to to reduce overall immune response over time um the histology on in our animals right now looks looks quite good and we wouldn't be working to take it to humans if the histology did not look good um and honestly i don't think we have pushed as hard as we can yet on the third thing i mentioned which is just again biological coatings that mitigate immune response but both the teeny tiny size the material property and the fact that we avoid all vasculature and move with the brain once it's in has actually we've we've been really pleasant i don't say pleasantly surprised like this was the design goal from the beginning um but the immune response is relatively manual minimal okay great um so i'm just picking we have we got tons of great great questions for you so um it's gonna go with the curveball yeah so um this one definitely touches on our theme a little bit more about what protective measures are being put in place to avoid hacking this device yeah this is one of those things we've got a couple guys at the company who are um just excellent within this domain so one one thing that's been funny going through neurolink has just been we have so many brilliant people um and sometimes it's not their time yet right like as an example um we've got a guy named joey who runs neural signals who's been at the company for three and a half years um but a lot of the early life of the company was just you know getting to a stable device that was high channel count and now we're actually implanting that device in monkeys and he's like you know the the greek god of monkey signals kind of situation and so his time has now come at neural language like yes we're doing awesome stuff with like complex brain signals like great great it's my time and so we actually do have a few folks at neurolink that joined um you know they're great across a whole bunch of things within like ee network spectrum but um they're really interested in working on the problem of like how how do you ensure this device does not get hacked and like you're thinking about it this is kind of the most um of an iot device this is the one that like if you hack it it's closest to home um we are there there are definitely a whole bunch of things on on the uh the firmware software side that uh we're doing to ensure it doesn't get hacked the reality of the situation is our attack surface doesn't open for at least another few years um and so it's just one of those problems that's going to be very very important but it's kind of like again like putting the cart before the horse like we need a useful device that's going to go to humans um kind of it's just a problem that we will put an extreme amount of energy in starting six to 12 months but we have a minimum viable solution now that again we've we've pre-cleared with uh you know how other medical device companies have dealt with similar types of implants um but again like if there are millions of people that millions of people that now have neural links uh you just need to ensure this thing is like iron clad but it's just it's just been too early to expend extreme resources on it since it's just it's like it's not in a person yet yeah um okay so here's another one so we have uh what are the concerns about needing to detach the technology to prevent over-stimulation [Music] god i got it got it okay yeah sorry the second half of the question um is super important too so um in terms of detaching to prevent overstimulation i mean this this device just obviously can be shut off at any time um a lot of the applications that we're talking about out of the gate are primarily read only and so you're not really you're not really talking about injecting current and if you're talking about injecting current it's very small amounts of current um and i think this is something that we're going to have to learn slowly through time if i look at the second half of this question so i'm talking increasing the bandwidth there are just a lot of things that we don't know yet right um like if if you could write more information to the brain what form does that take um basically like how much of it is actually usable i think one one hypothesis for how this ends up working is there are going to be things that are richer and more information dense than traditional language so right now like i have these complex concepts that i'm trying to communicate to you the most efficient thing humans have is like we created the technology that is language right and language works in written format language works in verbal trans and uh transference format um but i think one one strong hypothesis is that there's going to be an eclipsing technology to language once you have brain to brain communication it's unclear exactly how that's going to work um and obviously if you were just like hardcore stimming a bunch of portions of the brain what does that lead to that leads to seizure right and so you can't have that um so i i think one of the things that's going to happen in addition to the ability to again electrically right to the brain is to just have more core fundamental technologies for how information is transferred but again you can shut it off at any point and again it's just so easy to do things like one one beautiful example of an invasive brain device today is epilepsy monitoring systems right and they're both read write i think it's the only example of a functional read write device but the thing that they're trying to read is just gross activity in the brain which is a seizure right um and so one thing you can do with these devices is you are reading all the time right if you get any inkling that there might be some semblance of like runaway over simulation you just stop or you apply corrective force and so um preventing things like seizures is i think relatively trivial um figuring out how to like cram more information into you know every signal is again just an unsolved problem okay um so i think this may be one of our last questions but it's a little bit more technical but so how useful or transferable is research that's been done on non-invasive vcis those that use eeg to the work being done with neuralink um honestly almost not at all and that's not to say that those things aren't useful like they they are useful for understanding certain fundamental things about about the brain on mass but it's just like i think the best analogy that i've heard for explaining what the difference is is um like imagine a football stadium and like what kind of information you would get out of a football stadium depending on where you are and so if you are in a goodyear blimp outside you can hear when the crowd is cheering so like you can tell did something massive happen in the game or not right so you get that level of granularity now let's say you're way closer and you're basically in the nosebleeds and you're standing in the back you can hear a little bit more you can hear what some of the people in the crowd are saying but you you can't hear like what the coach is saying what the players are saying on the field right and so i think the difference here is that you know an eeg ends up being closer to that goodyear blimp because you can you can end up hearing what's happened like you get certain gross waves um but again that's like an aggregation of you know many millions of neurons right and then you can get closer you can do something called um eco which is you put like a sticker on the surface of the brain and so there you can get to find a grain resolution like a million neurons right um and then once you go inside the brain you can actually just get to single neuron resolution which is you can hear what the coach is saying you can hear what the player is saying and so i i would kind of just use that analogy to show you know what we've basically learned eegs and honestly things like fmri fall into kind of the same category you get a finer grain resolution of what's happening within certain brain regions on a course level but is that going to help you actually create a decoding model for doing 2d cursor movement just like it's just impossible okay great um so you've touched on a lot of these questions now but and i'm trying to understand what this one is um here i'll throw this up so can the device tell the difference between an abstract notion of like a left and that means left thought versus more concrete thought i mean you could you could do it both ways right so the way this is going to work um is there's going to be account so there's going to be just like a course calibration phase like say say i got the implant and i'm trying to use it for the first time the way this is going to work is i'm going to see that little cursor and it's going to be like the most efficient way is to say think of moving your hand to the right right and so if you think about moving your hand to the right or sorry we're going to the left in this particular case um what it's going to do is when i successfully do that like i might it might start doing this at first and then as i kind of like figure out what's going on his model figures out what's going on it's going to go to the left um and so in in that particular case especially since people understand motor left right that method is usually used for the calibration phase right which is just like think about moving that way you could also train it on literally anything like you could say move right when you think of a canary right and you could train the model to do that um obviously or the abstract concept of left you could do that um obviously that's a little bit trickier it's a little less linear for actually like getting to your result um because you know what happens when i want to go on a 45 degree angle right if i'm thinking of half canary and half hawk that's a little bit weird but if i have like trained myself to move right or to move up um i just end up getting a better result but like the point the broader point being you can basically like you can you can match whatever two concepts you want if you do that in a calibration phase okay so i think this will be our last one but um yeah sorry this has been a super engaging q a session and you've really provided some amazing responses so um what would you say your goal is looking for very far into the future as unrealistic as a theme i mean honestly the thing i care most about i just want ai to unfold in the world in the best way possible i mentioned shorter term that ends up being you know we're going to create this technology anyway how do we double down on using it for net good one reality and this is something i couldn't even talk about three four five years ago is is the notion of super intelligence it's like some people think this could be incredibly dystopian they think it could be the end of humanity some people think this could be incredibly utopian right and so i think one of the things that's really really hard for us to see and predict is what set of actions can we take to just like maximize the probability that we get that good future right we get i mean utopia is always tricky but like a humanity like basically a future where humanity's actually flourishing right um and so one of the things and i think for whatever reason naturally growing up i was always looking many years into the future is what can we do now and it's actually really tricky to understand what we can do now i mean neurolink is one of i think you know maybe 50 actions we could take right now but just basically maximize the probability that um agi and humanity kind of can coexist in in good possible ways i i mentioned i also work with open ai um and one of the goals there is to ensure that uh as this technology is developed it's developed in a way that includes many parties it's not just going to be one person who has a runaway advantage with this kind of like really really big and important technology that gets to decide what to do with it and so i think you know fundamentally i have a few goals one is that you know humanity as a species gets to participate and decisions made about ai agi as it unfolds in the world and we have a bunch of democratizing forces um that allow for that participation i think two is again like one of the things we're working on at neurolink is basically ensuring we get to go along for the ride like we've got we're literally creating a species um i think even if we didn't want to create it the the fundamental nature of this is that what is ai it's compute it's algorithms this data right like someone's going to make it from a game theory perspective um and so having mechanisms like uh you know a high band with brain machine interface that allow us to stay very close to this thing i think is kind of just super amazing and important and i also think just from like a humanity perspective you always want just diversification of um continued existence um and essentially enough inspiration to get you through the day so it's like you know some of the stuff i work on is like how do we prevent bad things from happening but then some of the other stuff is just like hey like it's so much cooler to wake up when humanity's trying to solve a whole bunch of inspiring problems and so whether or not you're working on climate change making like multi-planetary um or you know just like future of like ai created or human created art like we just need good reasons to to wake up every day even even in a scenario where you know kind of technology has taken just a different direction so um i think my goals as i as you've kind of seen from this answer are like somewhat diffuse but there's just like a whole array of things where you're just like oh man we can like increase the probability the future's gonna be like awesome um and so i just basically try and divide my time and hours on as many of those things as i can like productively help [Music] yeah great for sure i mean ai definitely has the power to increase the quality of life across all avenues for sure so uh i'd love for just another huge thing and i can say that it's a crazy revolutionary innovative company it's just monitoring how far ai's come to actually be able to implement such a precise interface with complex of our bodies it's just amazing [Music] so a great way to cap off the conference
